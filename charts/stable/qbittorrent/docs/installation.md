## Chart configuration

### Dataset Structure

You need to add a pesistence, for where your completed bittorrent files can be stores. For examle a NFS share:

```yaml
persistence:
  data:
    type: nfs
    # Example NFS Share
    server: "192.168.0.10"
    path: "/qbitvpn/"
```

### Networking

Add an `loadBalancerIP` to the `main` service or configure an Ingress if you prefer. Common documentation can be checked for more information.

### Listening Ports

:::tip[VPN "With VPN"]

- No need to port forward on your router
- If you want fast seeding, you will need a service that supports port forwarding and set the TCP Listening Port to the port Desired
- Mullvad for example, from Qbit Webui, Tools > Options > Connection tab. Set TCP Listening port to the Port Provided by Mullvad.

:::

:::tip[NOVPN "Without VPN"]

- You can leave the two ports default without a VPN
- If you want fast seeding though, you will need to port forward this port on your router

:::

An loadBalancer IP must assigned to the `Listening` port. Standard configures as port `6881`

```yaml
service:
  torrent:
    enabled: true
    type: LoadBalancer
    loadBalancerIP: 192.168.1.230
```

### VPN

Use the [Gluetun VPN Add-on Setup Guide](https://trueforge.org/truecharts/guides/addons/vpn-setup/)

    | Default Save Path:                                 | `/qbitvpn/complete `           | Set this to what you set your dataset mountpoint as                                  |

### Connection

This should equal to your listening port you set [during the installation](https://heavysetup.info/applications/qbittorrent/installation/#listening-ports)

![!Connection: qbit](./img/settings_connection.png)

<br />

### Speed

- Set `Alternative Rate Limits` to `10000` KiB
  - This is so during the day, or when users are using my Plex server, my qBittorrent instance isn't using _ALL_ of my bandwidth seeding
- Set my schedule from `08:00` to `02:00`
  - 8am to 2am, which is around the time users are watching Plex

<br />

### BitTorrent

- Disabled `Local Peer Discovery`
  - This is only useful if you are on a huge network, like a college campus or something like that

![!Speed: qbit](./img/settings_bittorrent.png)

<br />

### WebGUI

- Changed the password to something We would remember

Added both my LAN and Kubernetes LAN to the bypass list, this way neither of them have to authenticate, it gets annoying to log in over and over on your own network

**Bypass authentication for clients in whitelisted IP subnets**

- `192.168.0.0/16`
- `172.16.0.0/16`

![!Speed: qbit](./img/settings_webgui1.png)

Add the Kubernetes LAN to:

**Enable reverse proxy support**

- `172.16.0.0/16`
